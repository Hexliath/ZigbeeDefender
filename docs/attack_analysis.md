# What can be used to simulate attacks

- src not known by the coordinator
- pan_id different
- encryption_status at 0
- radius has to be the same for all the network
- zbee_counter : unique by src
- frame_counter : unique by src
- payload : device_nb unkown, abnormal temperature or luminosity

# Improvent:

- Adding seconds, and analyse sending frequency
- model en temps r√©el
